# Ordered-Linear-Search
Example of ordered linear search in python.
Adding to my notes for python data structures and algorithms.
This is an improvement on the unordered linear search. We no longer have to 
blindly search through every item in the list to find the item that we are looking for.
However this is still an inefficient means of searching as the worst case scenario is that our 
item is the very last item in the list O(n). We can still do better.
